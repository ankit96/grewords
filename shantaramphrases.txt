Thelegends say that we know her by her wings—the wings that only we can see—and because wanting
her kills every other desire of love.
The same legends also carry warnings that such fated love may, sometimes, be the possession and
the obsession of one, and only one, of the two souls twinned by destiny. But wisdom, in one sense, is
the opposite of love. Love survives in us precisely because it isn’t wise.


Fate needs accomplices, and the stones in destiny’s walls are mortared with small and
heedless complicities such as those. I look back, now, and I know that the naming moment, which
seemed so insignificant then, which seemed to demand no more than an arbitrary and superstitious yes
or no, was in fact a pivotal moment in my life.


The past reflects eternally between two
mirrors—the bright mirror of words and deeds, and the dark one, full of things we didn’t do or say.


No-one, and nothing, could really
hurt me. No-one, and nothing, could make me very happy. I was tough, which is probably the saddest
thing you can say about a man.


The
great principles and the noble virtues are all very well, in the long run of history, but from one day to
the next, it’s money that keeps us going


There is a difference between the dishonest
bribe and the honest bribe, Didier Levy once said to me. The dishonest bribe is the same in every
country, but the honest bribe is India’s alone.

Civilisation, after all, is defined by what
we forbid, more than what we permit.’


The first rule of black business everywhere is: never let anyone know what you’re thinking

always know what the other thinks of you.

The truth is a bully

Your heart starts to feel like an overcrowded lifeboat. You
throw your pride out to keep it afloat, and your self-respect and your independence. After a while you
start throwing people out—your friends, everyone you used to know. And it’s still not enough. The
lifeboat is still sinking, and you know it’s going to take you down with it.




There’s a truth that’s deeper than experience. It’s beyond what we see, or even what we feel. It’s an
order of truth that separates the profound from the merely clever, and the reality from the perception.
We’re helpless, usually, in the face of it; and the cost of knowing it, like the cost of knowing love, is
sometimes greater than any heart would willingly pay. It doesn’t always help us to love the world, but
it does prevent us from hating the world. And the only way to know that truth is to share it, from heart
to heart, just as Prabaker told it to me, just as I’m telling it to you now.


It is the mark of the age in which we
live that the style becomes the attitude, instead of the attitude becoming the style.




‘I think that we all, each one of us, we all have to earn our future,’ she said slowly. ‘I think the
future is like anything else that’s important. It has to be earned. If we don’t earn it, we don’t have a
future at all. And if we don’t earn it, if we don’t deserve it, we have to live in the present, more or
less forever. Or worse, we have to live in the past. I think that’s probably what love is—a way of
earning the future.’

‘I mean that you are making things to be more difficult than they are, or need to be. The facts of life
are very simple. In the beginning we feared everything—animals, the weather, the trees, the night sky
—everything except each other. Now we fear each other, and almost nothing else. No-one knows why
anyone does anything. No-one tells the truth. No-one is happy. No-one is safe. In the face of all that is
so wrong with the world, the very worst thing you can do is survive. And yet you must survive. It is
this dilemma that makes us believe and cling to the lie that we have a soul, and that there is a God
who cares about its fate. And now you have it.’

‘No man is as cool as he looks,

the real trick in life is to want nothing, and to succeed in getting it.’


Prabaker’s face moved from apprehension to anguish.

Sometimes you have to surrender, Karla said, before you win.



One of the reasons
why we crave love, and seek it so desperately, is that love is the only cure for loneliness, and shame,
and sorrow. But some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them
again. Some truths about yourself are so painful that only shame can help you live with them. And
some things are just so sad that only your soul can do the crying for you.



no happiness exists without its
woe, no wealth without its cost, and no life without its full measure, sooner or later, of sorrowing and
death.
